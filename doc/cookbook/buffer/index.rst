A buffer, often called SKU -stock keeping unit-, is a (physical or logical) inventory point.

There are different buffer types:

* **default**: a buffer that is replenished with a producing operation
* **procure**: a buffer that is replenished with a procurement operation
* **infinite supply**: a buffer without replenishing operation
