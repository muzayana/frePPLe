frePPLe |release| documentation
===============================


To get started we suggest the following **introduction trail**:

#. | :doc:`Install the software <installation-guide/windows-installer>`
   | The easiest start to learn frePPLe is to use the online demo
     environment.
   | To try on your own computer you'll need to install the PostgreSQL
     database server, and then run the frePPLe installer.

#. | :doc:`Follow the guided tour <user-guide/guided-tour>`
   | The application has an integrated guided tour. It interactively guides
     you through all important screens in less than 10 minutes.

#. | :doc:`Learn the modelling concepts <model-reference/concepts>`
   | This page introduces the main modelling concepts you'll need to
     understand.

#. | The :doc:`cookbook <cookbook/index>` has some example models which
     demonstrate specific functionalities.
   | It is a good idea to study and try out some of those, before you start
     building your own model.

#. | Visit to the community forum https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/frepple-users
   | You're invited to post questions, suggestions and issues to the group.
