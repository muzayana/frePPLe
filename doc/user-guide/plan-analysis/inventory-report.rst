Inventory report
================

The report shows per buffer and per time bucket the inventory profile:
the starting inventory, the material consumed, the material produced and
the ending inventory.

If the report is opened for a single buffer an inventory graph is displayed.

| The rows in the report are defined such that following equations apply:
|   **end inventory = start inventory + produced â€“ consumed**
|   **start inventory = end inventory of the previous time bucket**
