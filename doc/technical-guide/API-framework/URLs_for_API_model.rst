=============
API framework
=============

In the "List API for [model name]",
you will see the request that was made to the rest framework,

the headers from the HTTP response,

and a text box with the list of records that are available.

In the bottom, depending on your permissions, you will see a menu with different options.

In this menu you may issue a new GET request on JSON or API formats.

You may also also issue a OPTIONS request to see what values are accepted on the fields.

If you have permissions that allow you to add records you will also see two more menu options.

The third menu entry will show an HTML form that you can send in a POST request in the case of inserting a single record in the database.

The fourth option will allow you to send a POST request to the database by changing the information in the text area.
Here you can also select the format "application/json", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" or "multipart/form-data".
