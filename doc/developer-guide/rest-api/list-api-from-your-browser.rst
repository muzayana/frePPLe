==========================
List API from your browser
==========================

The top part of this screen show the headers and content of the HTTP response of the web service.

The different sections below allow you to create new request for the GET, OPTIONS, POST, PUT,
PATCH and DELETE HTTP methods.
Some models will allow bulk operations. For these requests in JSON format have been tested for bulk POST (using a LIST as argument).
Requesting a bulk DELETE requires that the number of records to be deleted is smaller than the total of the table.
