FrePPLe is an easy-to-use and easy-to-implement open source production planning tool.
When spreadsheets doesn't suffice any longer to adequately plan your production, frePPLe allows in a easy and cost-efficient way to generate a more optimized plan.

FrePPLe implements planning algoritmes based on best practices such as **theory of constraints** (ie plan around the bottleneck), **pull-based planning** (ie start production as late as possible and directly triggered by demand) and **lean manufacturing** (ie avoid intermeditate delays and stock).
