class Dashboard:
  '''
  Widgets are UI components that can be added to the dashboard.
  Subclasses need to follow these conventions:
    - They can only be defined in a file "widget.py" in an application module.
    - In the file widget.py each widget needs to register itself by calling
      the method Widget.register().
    - We don't expect widgets to be instantiated.
    - Class attribute "name" needs to provide a short, unique identifier
      for the widget. This string is also used for the URL to access the
      widget, so keep it short and avoid special characters.
    - Class attribute 'title' needs to a translatable title string for
      the title bar of the widget.
    - Class attribute 'async' is a boolean specifying whether the widget
      is immediately rendered in the page, or asynchronously with an
      Ajax request.
    - Class method render(request) is called to render the widget to the
      client browser.
      It should return HTML content for synchronous widgets.
      It should return a Django response object for asynchronous widgets.
